description: Step-by-step guide to installing and setting up Osprey Tilt String or In-Place Extensometer for initial monitoring.
---

## Prerequisites

<Callout kind="info" title="Before You Begin">
Ensure you have the following:

- Osprey Tilt String (OTS) or In-Place Extensometer (IPX) device
- Data logger compatible with serial bus (e.g., Campbell Scientific CR series)
- Mounting hardware (clamps, anchors, or concrete embedding materials)
- Multimeter for basic electrical checks
- Laptop with Python 3+ and `pyserial` library for data verification
- Site survey confirming stable mounting points

Review the product data sheet for your specific model.
</Callout>

## Unboxing and Required Tools

Upon receiving your Osprey device, verify the contents:

1. Sensor cable with micro-tilts (OTS) or extensometer rods (IPX)
2. Termination connectors
3. Mounting brackets and fixings
4. Quick-start guide

Gather these tools for installation:

| Tool              | Purpose                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Torque wrench     | Secure mounting to spec          |
| Cable crimper     | Sensor bus connections           |
| Level             | Ensure vertical alignment        |
| Serial adapter    | Connect to data logger           |

## Site Preparation and Mounting

Prepare your site by clearing debris and marking measurement points. Osprey devices support multiple mounting options.

      <Step title="Embed in Concrete">
        Position the cable in formwork for diaphragm walls or tower cores. Space sensors at 0.5m intervals for high precision.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Trench or Surface Mount">
        Lay in trenches with pipelines or fix to retaining walls using clamps. Ensure cable protection from traffic.

      <Step title="Borehole Installation">
        Drill borehole and insert anchor rods. Grout extensometer in place for stable reference.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Surface Mounting">
        Anchor to structural elements like piles or walls. Verify alignment with a plumb line.

<Callout kind="tip">
Always test continuity with a multimeter before finalizing mounts. Target vibration tolerance exceeds 10g.
</Callout>

## Connect to Data Logger

Route the single serial bus cable to your data logger. Use waterproof connectors for outdoor deployments.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Power Up">
    Connect power (typically 12V DC) and ground. Verify no shorts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Logger">
    Set baud rate to 9600 and polling interval to 1 minute.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Terminate Bus">
    Add 120Ω resistor at the end for signal integrity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## First Data Reading and Verification

Use this Python script to poll the sensor bus and verify readings.

<CodeGroup tabs="Python" show-lines="true">
  ```python
  import serial
  import time

  ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600, timeout=1)  # Adjust port as needed

  while True:
      ser.write(b'POLL\n')  # Send poll command
      data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
      if data:
          print(f"Tilt readings: {data}")  # e.g., "Tilt1: 0.12deg, Tilt2: 0.05deg"
      time.sleep(60)  # Poll every minute
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Expect tilt values in degrees (`<0.01°` precision) or extension in mm. Compare against known baselines.

- No data: Check baud rate and termination.
- Erratic readings: Secure loose mounts.
- Logger errors: Update firmware via manufacturer tools.
