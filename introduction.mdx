## Overview

Osprey Measurement Systems provides advanced geotechnical and structural instrumentation for the civil and resources sectors. You get monitoring solutions that automate manual processes, simplify installation, and reduce costs. Key products like the Osprey Tilt String (`OTS`) and In-Place Extensometer (`IPX`) deliver precise measurements for assets such as diaphragm walls, pipelines, railways, and retaining walls.

## Key Benefits

Osprey systems stand out with features designed for real-world deployment.
